						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there are specific guidelines for using animation in user interfaces. These guidelines include considerations for animation duration and speed, the use of easing for natural motion, choreography to guide user attention, and how the path of movement and interaction between objects should be handled. It's important to make interface animations mimic real-world movements while not causing delays or distractions for users. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the explanation of different types of easing curves for animations, such as ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out. It's interesting to see how these curves can be used to create natural and engaging animations in user interfaces. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> ["Animation in interfaces should reflect the movements that we know from the physical world â€” friction, acceleration, etc. Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface." </p>
						</li>
