                            <p> I learned how diverse the world of UI could be via Muzli design inspiration. The UI design should be not only user-centered design, but also be easy to access. Furthermore, it should be mobile-first design.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was looking at different inspirations for the UI design. There were some designs that totally blew up my mind. It was nice to see different inspirations all at once.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is where it introduces the add to cart interaction by Dannniel for Norde. It was really inspiring how they made the size selection part into a ruler. Usually most websites have it as a button to select the size but it was inspiring how they put ruler to scroll to select the size. </p>
