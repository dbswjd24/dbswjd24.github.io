    <p>Hi! My name is Eileen and I am trying to declare computer science for my major as I want to work in the ui/ux field. 
        Web Design decal would help me with having prior experience with ui/ux outside of class work. 
        I'm really looking forward to learn new materials every week.

    <li>I learned the importance of actively studying and analyzing the design of apps to improve one's product sense and design skills.
        It emphasizes the need to think like a designer and pay attention to elements such as hierarchy, content, intent, and audience when examining an app's design.

    <li>My favorite part of the article is when it encourages the readers to break down and analyze popular apps like Twitter, Spotify, and Airbnb. 
        It provides specific observations and prompts to consider while studying these apps, which can be a valuable exercise for anyone looking to enhance their design skills.

    <li>The most compelling quote from this article is "Next time you are sitting in a Lyft or waiting on a friend, open up an app and think through the reasons why the designers chose to design it that way. 
        By routinely analyzing other apps, you will develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."
        It's because this quote underscores the importance of continuous learning and analysis in the field of design.
