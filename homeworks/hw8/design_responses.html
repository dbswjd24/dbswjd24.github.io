						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> From the article "Dark patterns in UX: how designers should be responsible for their actions" by Arushi Jaiswal, I learned about the concept of Dark Patterns in UX/UI design. These are deceptive interactions designed to mislead or trick users into doing something against their interests, often for the benefit of the business. The article highlights the ethical implications of such designs and urges designers to be responsible and focus on transparency with users. </p>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was the exploration of different types of Dark Patterns, such as Bait and Switch, Disguised Ads, and Friend Spam. This section was particularly insightful as it provided real-world examples of these practices, helping to understand how they manifest in everyday online experiences. It emphasized the need for ethical design practices in the digital world. </p>
