							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that accessibility in digital design means making sure that websites and apps can be used by everyone, including those with disabilities like vision problems or difficulty using a mouse or keyboard. This is important because there are many people with disabilities, and it's not fair to exclude them from using technology. It's also a legal requirement in some places, and it can make products better for everyone. The article also taught me some practical tips, like making sure colors have good contrast and not relying only on color to convey information. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>  I think the most important part of the article is when it talks about why accessibility is important. It says that being accessible is the right thing to do because it includes everyone, and it's also a legal requirement in some places. This means that all people, including those with disabilities, should be able to use digital products and websites easily. </p>
